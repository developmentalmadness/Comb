The background on this project is in the following two articles. The original idea isn't mine, but the implementation is.

The main idea for the project is that I needed to generate GUID/UUID values on different servers but I wanted to avoid the performance issues (index fragmentation, random INSERT ops). So I couldn't use SQL Server NEWSEQUENTIALID() or Win32 CreateSequentialUUID. The current implementation will prevent fragmentation as much as is possible when generating decentralized key values. However, if you're generating keys from w/in the same process they are guaranteed to be sequential.
